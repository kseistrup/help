realpath [--] name
    Prints the resolved absolute pathname corresponding to name.  If
    name ends with a slash (‘/’), it's also checked for existence and
    whether it is a directory; otherwise, realpath returns 0 if the
    pathname either exists or can be created immediately, i.e. all but
    the last component exist and are directories.  For calls from the
    shell, if any options are given, an external realpath(1) utility
    is preferred over the builtin.
