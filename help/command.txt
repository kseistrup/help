command [-pVv] cmd [arg ...]
    If neither the -v nor -V option is given, cmd is executed exactly
    as if command had not been specified, with two exceptions:
    firstly, cmd cannot be a shell function; and secondly, special
    built-in commands lose their specialness (i.e. redirection and
    utility errors do not cause the shell to exit, and command assign‚Äê
    ments are not permanent).  The declaration utility property is not
    reset.

    If the -p option is given, a default search path is used instead
    of the current value of PATH, the actual value of which is system
    dependent.

    If the -v option is given, instead of executing cmd, information
    about what would be executed is given (and the same is done for
    arg ...).  For builtins, functions and keywords, their names are
    simply printed; for aliases, a command that defines them is
    printed; for utilities found by searching the PATH parameter, the
    full path of the command is printed.  If no command is found (i.e.
    the path search fails), nothing is printed and command exits with
    a non-zero status.  The -V option is like the -v option, except it
    is more verbose.
