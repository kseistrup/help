time [-p] [pipeline]
    If a pipeline is given, the times used to execute the pipeline are
    reported.  If no pipeline is given, then the user and system time
    used by the shell itself, and all the commands it has run since it
    was started, are reported.  The times reported are the real time
    (elapsed time from start to finish), the user CPU time (time spent
    running in user mode), and the system CPU time (time spent running
    in kernel mode).  Times are reported to standard error; the format
    of the output is:

          0m0.00s real     0m0.00s user     0m0.00s system

    If the -p option is given the output is slightly longer:

          real     0.00
          user     0.00
          sys      0.00

    It is an error to specify the -p option unless pipeline is a sim‐
    ple command.

    Simple redirections of standard error do not affect the output of
    the time command:

          $ time sleep 1 2>afile
          $ { time sleep 1; } 2>afile

    Times for the first command do not go to “afile”, but those of the
    second command do.
