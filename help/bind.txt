bind [-l]
    The current bindings are listed.  If the -l flag is given, bind
    instead lists the names of the functions to which keys may be
    bound.  See Emacs editing mode for more information.

bind [-m] string=[substitute] ...
bind string=[editing-command] ...
    The specified editing command is bound to the given string, which
    should consist of a control character optionally preceded by one
    of the two prefix characters and optionally succeeded by a tilde
    character.  Future input of the string will cause the editing com‚Äê
    mand to be immediately invoked.  If the -m flag is given, the
    specified input string will afterwards be immediately replaced by
    the given substitute string which may contain editing commands but
    not other macros.  If a tilde postfix is given, a tilde trailing
    the one or two prefices and the control character is ignored, any
    other trailing character will be processed afterwards.

    Control characters may be written using caret notation i.e. ^X
    represents Ctrl-X.  Note that although only two prefix characters
    (usually ESC and ^X) are supported, some multi-character sequences
    can be supported.

    The following default bindings show how the arrow keys, the home,
    end and delete key on a BSD wsvt25, xterm-xfree86 or GNU screen
    terminal are bound (of course some escape sequences won't work out
    quite this nicely):

          bind '^X'=prefix-2
          bind '^[['=prefix-2
          bind '^XA'=up-history
          bind '^XB'=down-history
          bind '^XC'=forward-char
          bind '^XD'=backward-char
          bind '^X1~'=beginning-of-line
          bind '^X7~'=beginning-of-line
          bind '^XH'=beginning-of-line
          bind '^X4~'=end-of-line
          bind '^X8~'=end-of-line
          bind '^XF'=end-of-line
          bind '^X3~'=delete-char-forward
