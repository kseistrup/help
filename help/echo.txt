echo [-Een] [arg ...]
    Warning: this utility is not portable; use the Korn shell builtin
    print instead.

    Prints its arguments (separated by spaces) followed by a newline,
    to the standard output.  The newline is suppressed if any of the
    arguments contain the backslash sequence “\c”.  See the print com‐
    mand below for a list of other backslash sequences that are recog‐
    nised.

    The options are provided for compatibility with BSD shell scripts.
    The -n option suppresses the trailing newline, -e enables back‐
    slash interpretation (a no-op, since this is normally done), and
    -E suppresses backslash interpretation.

    If the posix or sh option is set or this is a direct builtin call
    or print -R, only the first argument is treated as an option, and
    only if it is exactly “-n”.  Backslash interpretation is disabled.
