alias [-d | -t [-r] | +-x] [-p] [+] [name [=value] ...]
    Without arguments, alias lists all aliases.  For any name without
    a value, the existing alias is listed.  Any name with a value
    defines an alias (see Aliases above).  [A-Za-z0-9_!%,@-] are valid
    in names except they may not begin with a hyphen-minus.

    When listing aliases, one of two formats is used.  Normally,
    aliases are listed as name=value, where value is quoted.  If
    options were preceded with ‘+’, or a lone ‘+’ is given on the com‐
    mand line, only name is printed.

    The -d option causes directory aliases which are used in tilde
    expansion to be listed or set (see Tilde expansion above).

    If the -p option is used, each alias is prefixed with the string
    “alias ”.

    The -t option indicates that tracked aliases are to be listed/set
    (values specified on the command line are ignored for tracked
    aliases).  The -r option indicates that all tracked aliases are to
    be reset.

    The -x option sets (+x clears) the export attribute of an alias,
    or, if no names are given, lists the aliases with the export
    attribute (exporting an alias has no effect).
