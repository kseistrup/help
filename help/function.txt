function name { list; }
   Defines the function name (see Functions below).  Note that redi‐
   rections specified after a function definition are performed when‐
   ever the function is executed, not when the function definition is
   executed.

function name() { list; }
   The same as name() (bashism).  The function keyword is ignored.
