ulimit [-aBCcdefHilMmnOPpqrSsTtVvw] [value]
    Display or set process limits.  If no options are used, the file
    size limit (-f) is assumed.  value, if specified, may be either an
    arithmetic expression or the word “unlimited”.  The limits affect
    the shell and any processes created by the shell after a limit is
    imposed.  Note that some systems may not allow limits to be
    increased once they are set.  Also note that the types of limits
    available are system dependent – some systems have only the -f
    limit, or not even that, or can set only the soft limits

    -a     Display all limits; unless -H is used, soft limits are dis‐
           played.

    -B n   Set the socket buffer size to n kibibytes.

    -C n   Set the number of cached threads to n.

    -c n   Impose a size limit of n blocks on the size of core dumps.

    -d n   Impose a size limit of n kibibytes on the size of the data
           area.

    -e n   Set the maximum niceness to n.

    -f n   Impose a size limit of n blocks on files written by the
           shell and its child processes (files of any size may be
           read).

    -H     Set the hard limit only (the default is to set both hard
           and soft limits).

    -i n   Set the number of pending signals to n.

    -l n   Impose a limit of n kibibytes on the amount of locked
           (wired) physical memory.

    -M n   Set the AIO locked memory to n kibibytes.

    -m n   Impose a limit of n kibibytes on the amount of physical
           memory used.

    -n n   Impose a limit of n file descriptors that can be open at
           once.

    -O n   Set the number of AIO operations to n.

    -P n   Limit the number of threads per process to n.

    -p n   Impose a limit of n processes that can be run by the user
           at any one time.

    -q n   Limit the size of POSIX message queues to n bytes.

    -r n   Set the maximum real-time priority to n.

    -S     Set the soft limit only (the default is to set both hard
           and soft limits).

    -s n   Impose a size limit of n kibibytes on the size of the stack
           area.

    -T n   Impose a time limit of n real seconds to be used by each
           process.

    -t n   Impose a time limit of n CPU seconds spent in user mode to
           be used by each process.

    -V n   Set the number of vnode monitors on Haiku to n.

    -v n   Impose a limit of n kibibytes on the amount of virtual mem‐
           ory (address space) used.

    -w n   Impose a limit of n kibibytes on the amount of swap space
           used.

    As far as ulimit is concerned, a block is 512 bytes.
