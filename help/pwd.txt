pwd [-LP]
    Print the present working directory.  If the -L option is used or
    if the physical option isn't set (see the set command below), the
    logical path is printed (i.e. the path used to cd to the current
    directory).  If the -P option (physical path) is used or if the
    physical option is set, the path determined from the filesystem
    (by following “..” directories to the root directory) is printed.
