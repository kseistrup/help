select name [in word ...]; do list; done
   The select statement provides an automatic method of presenting the
   user with a menu and selecting from it.  An enumerated list of the
   specified word(s) is printed on standard error, followed by a
   prompt (PS3: normally “#? ”).  A number corresponding to one of the
   enumerated words is then read from standard input, name is set to
   the selected word (or unset if the selection is not valid), REPLY
   is set to what was read (leading/trailing space is stripped), and
   list is executed.  If a blank line (i.e. zero or more IFS octets)
   is entered, the menu is reprinted without executing list.

   When list completes, the enumerated list is printed if REPLY is
   empty, the prompt is printed, and so on.  This process continues
   until an end-of-file is read, an interrupt is received, or a break
   statement is executed inside the loop.  If “in word ...” is omit‐
   ted, the positional parameters are used (i.e. $1, $2, etc.).  For
   historical reasons, open and close braces may be used instead of do
   and done e.g. select i; { echo $i; }.  The exit status of a select
   statement is zero if a break statement is used to exit the loop,
   non-zero otherwise.
