cd [-L] [dir]
cd -P [-e] [dir]
chdir [-eLP] [dir]
    Set the working directory to dir.  If the parameter CDPATH is set,
    it lists the search path for the directory containing dir.  An
    unset or empty path means the current directory.  If dir is found
    in any component of the CDPATH search path other than an unset or
    empty path, the name of the new working directory will be written
    to standard output.  If dir is missing, the home directory HOME is
    used.  If dir is “-”, the previous working directory is used (see
    the OLDPWD parameter).

    If the -L option (logical path) is used or if the physical option
    isn't set (see the set command below), references to “..” in dir
    are relative to the path used to get to the directory.  If the -P
    option (physical path) is used or if the physical option is set,
    “..” is relative to the filesystem directory tree.  The PWD and
    OLDPWD parameters are updated to reflect the current and old work‐
    ing directory, respectively.  If the -e option is set for physical
    filesystem traversal and PWD could not be set, the exit code is 1;
    greater than 1 if an error occurred, 0 otherwise.

cd [-eLP] old new
chdir [-eLP] old new
    The string new is substituted for old in the current directory,
    and the shell attempts to change to the new directory.
