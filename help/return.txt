return [status]
    Returns from a function or . script, with exit status status.  If
    no status is given, the exit status of the last executed command
    is used.  If used outside of a function or . script, it has the
    same effect as exit.  Note that mksh treats both profile and ENV
    files as . scripts, while the original Korn shell only treats pro‚Äê
    files as . scripts.
