hash [-r] [name ...]
    Without arguments, any hashed executable command pathnames are
    listed.  The -r option causes all hashed commands to be removed
    from the hash table.  Each name is searched as if it were a com‐
    mand name and added to the hash table if it is an executable com‐
    mand.
