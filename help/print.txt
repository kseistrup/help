print [-AcelNnprsu[n] | -R [-n]] [argument ...]
    Print the specified argument(s) on the standard output, separated
    by spaces, terminated with a newline.  The escapes mentioned in
    Backslash expansion above, as well as “\c”, which is equivalent to
    using the -n option, are interpreted.

    The options are as follows:

    -A      Each argument is arithmetically evaluated; the character
            corresponding to the resulting value is printed.  Empty
            arguments separate input words.

    -c      The output is printed columnised, line by line, similar to
            how the rs(1) utility, tab completion, the kill -l built-
            in utility and the select statement do.

    -e      Restore backslash expansion after a previous -r.

    -l      Change the output word separator to newline.

    -N      Change the output word and line separator to ASCII NUL.

    -n      Do not print the trailing line separator.

    -p      Print to the co-process (see Co-processes above).

    -r      Inhibit backslash expansion.

    -s      Print to the history file instead of standard output.

    -u[n]   Print to the file descriptor n (defaults to 1 if omitted)
            instead of standard output.

    The -R option mostly emulates the BSD echo(1) command which does
    not expand backslashes and interprets its first argument as option
    only if it is exactly “-n” (to suppress the trailing newline).
