wait [job ...]
    Wait for the specified job(s) to finish.  The exit status of wait
    is that of the last specified job; if the last job is killed by a
    signal, the exit status is 128 + the number of the signal (see
    kill -l exit-status above); if the last specified job can't be
    found (because it never existed or had already finished), the exit
    status of wait is 127.  See Job control below for the format of
    job.  wait will return if a signal for which a trap has been set
    is received or if a SIGHUP, SIGINT or SIGQUIT signal is received.

    If no jobs are specified, wait waits for all currently running
    jobs (if any) to finish and exits with a zero status.  If job mon‚Äê
    itoring is enabled, the completion status of jobs is printed (this
    is not the case when jobs are explicitly specified).
