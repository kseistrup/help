readonly [-p] [parameter [=value] ...]
    Sets the read-only attribute of the named parameters.  This is a
    declaration utility.  If values are given, parameters are set to
    them before setting the attribute.  Once a parameter is made read-
    only, it cannot be unset and its value cannot be changed.

    If no parameters are specified, the names of all parameters with
    the read-only attribute are printed one per line, unless the -p
    option is used, in which case readonly commands defining all read-
    only parameters, including their values, are printed.
