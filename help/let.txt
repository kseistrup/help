let [expression ...]
    Each expression is evaluated (see Arithmetic expressions above).
    If all expressions are successfully evaluated, the exit status is
    0 (1) if the last expression evaluated to non-zero (zero).  If an
    error occurs during the parsing or evaluation of an expression,
    the exit status is greater than 1.  Since expressions may need to
    be quoted, (( expr )) is syntactic sugar for:
          { \\builtin let 'expr'; }
