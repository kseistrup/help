export [-p] [parameter[=value]]
    Sets the export attribute of the named parameters.  Exported
    parameters are passed in the environment to executed commands.  If
    values are specified, the named parameters are also assigned.
    This is a declaration utility.

    If no parameters are specified, all parameters with the export
    attribute set are printed one per line; either their names, or, if
    a “-” with no option letter is specified, name=value pairs, or,
    with -p, export commands suitable for re-entry.
