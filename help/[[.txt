[[ expression ]]
   Similar to the test and [ ... ] commands (described later), with
   the following exceptions:

   ·   Field splitting and file name generation are not performed on
       arguments.

   ·   The -a (AND) and -o (OR) operators are replaced with “&&” and
       “||”, respectively.

   ·   Operators (e.g. “-f”, “=”, “!”) must be unquoted.

   ·   Parameter, command and arithmetic substitutions are performed
       as expressions are evaluated and lazy expression evaluation is
       used for the “&&” and “||” operators.  This means that in the
       following statement, $(<foo) is evaluated if and only if the
       file foo exists and is readable:

             $ [[ -r foo && $(<foo) = b*r ]]

   ·   The second operand of the “!=” and “=” expressions are a subset
       of patterns (e.g. the comparison [[ foobar = f*r ]] succeeds).
       This even works indirectly:

             $ bar=foobar; baz='f*r'
             $ [[ $bar = $baz ]]; echo $?
             $ [[ $bar = "$baz" ]]; echo $?

       Perhaps surprisingly, the first comparison succeeds, whereas
       the second doesn't.  This does not apply to all extglob
       metacharacters, currently.
