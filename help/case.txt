case word in [[(] pattern [| pattern] ...) list terminator] ... esac
   The case statement attempts to match word against a specified
   pattern; the list associated with the first successfully matched
   pattern is executed.  Patterns used in case statements are the same
   as those used for file name patterns except that the restrictions
   regarding ‘.’ and ‘/’ are dropped.  Note that any unquoted space
   before and after a pattern is stripped; any space within a pattern
   must be quoted.  Both the word and the patterns are subject to
   parameter, command and arithmetic substitution, as well as tilde
   substitution.

   For historical reasons, open and close braces may be used instead
   of in and esac e.g. case $foo { *) echo bar ;; }.

   The list terminators are:

   “;;”  Terminate after the list.

   “;&”  Fall through into the next list.

   “;|”  Evaluate the remaining pattern-list tuples.

   The exit status of a case statement is that of the executed list;
   if no list is executed, the exit status is zero.
