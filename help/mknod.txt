mknod [-m mode] name b|c major minor
mknod [-m mode] name p
    Create a device special file.  The file type may be b (block type
    device), c (character type device) or p (named pipe, FIFO).  The
    file created may be modified according to its mode (via the -m
    option), major (major device number), and minor (minor device num‚Äê
    ber).  This is not normally part of mksh; however, distributors
    may have added this as builtin as a speed hack.
