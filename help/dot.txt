. file [arg ...]
    This is called the “dot” command.  Execute the commands in file in
    the current environment.  The file is searched for in the directo‐
    ries of PATH.  If arguments are given, the positional parameters
    may be used to access them while file is being executed.  If no
    arguments are given, the positional parameters are those of the
    environment the command is used in.

source file [arg ...]
    Like . (“dot”), except that the current working directory is
    appended to the search path (GNU bash extension).
